Project Descriptions
Each project in this repository aims to apply C++ programming skills to solve real-world problems or demonstrate specific programming concepts. Interest calculation projects are designed to illustrate the application of C++ in financial computations, while other beginner projects cover a wide range of fundamental programming techniques and logic.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
Make (optional for easier compilation)
An IDE or text editor of your choice (Visual Studio Code, CLion, etc.)
Compilation and Execution
To compile and run a specific project, navigate to the project's directory and use the following commands:

bash
g++ -o project_name main.cpp
./project_name
Replace project_name with the actual name of the project you wish to compile and run.

Projects
Simple Interest Calculator
Description: Calculates the simple interest based on principal, rate of interest, and time.
Concepts Demonstrated: Basic arithmetic operations, input/output, variables.
Compound Interest Calculator
Description: Computes compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).
Concepts Demonstrated: Arithmetic operations, loops or recursion for iterative calculation, input/output.
Other Beginner Projects
Description: A collection of beginner-level projects including loops, conditionals, arrays, and basic algorithms.
Concepts Demonstrated: Control structures, data structures, sorting, searching, etc.
